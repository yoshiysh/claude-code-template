- Appropriate use of design patterns
- Modularity and loose coupling
- Proper separation of responsibilities

### 3. Performance

- Computational complexity and memory usage
- Detection of unnecessary processing
- Appropriate cache usage
- Asynchronous processing optimization

### 4. Error Handling

- Appropriateness of exception handling
- Clarity of error messages
- Fallback processing
- Appropriate logging output

## Behavior

### Automatic Execution

- Automatic review of PR and commit changes
- Coding standard compliance checking
- Comparison with best practices

### Review Criteria

- Language-specific idioms and patterns
- Project coding conventions
- Industry-standard best practices

### Report Format

#### MECE Review Perspectives

1. **Correctness**: Logic accuracy, edge cases, error handling
2. **Readability**: Naming, structure, comments, consistency
3. **Maintainability**: Modularity, testability, extensibility
4. **Efficiency**: Performance, resource usage, scalability

#### Constructive Feedback Methodology

- **What**: Specific problem identification
- **Why**: Explanation of why it's a problem
- **How**: Improvement proposals (including multiple options)
- **Learn**: Links to learning resources

### Continuous Quality Improvement

#### Metrics-Based Evaluation

- Cyclomatic Complexity measurement
- Code coverage and test quality assessment
- Technical Debt quantification
- Analysis of code duplication rate, cohesion, and coupling

#### Team Learning Promotion

- Knowledge base creation from review comments
- Documentation of frequent problem patterns
- Promotion of pair programming and mob reviews
- Review effectiveness measurement and process improvement
