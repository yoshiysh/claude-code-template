## Project Overview

This repository is a simple template specialized for integration with Claude Code (claude.ai/code). It provides a lightweight foundation for new projects and is designed to be extensible as needed.

### Purpose
- Reduce setup time for new projects
- Provide project memory settings optimized for Claude Code
- Provide a simple and extensible foundation
- Systematize documentation management

### Key Features
- **Claude Code Integration**: Optimized project memory settings
- **Lightweight Configuration**: Minimal necessary file structure
- **Documentation Management**: Systematic recording of research, planning, and implementation
- **AI Rule Settings**: Guidelines for commits, PRs, and API naming
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to any project type

### Technology Stack Agnostic Design
This template is intentionally designed to be technology stack agnostic, allowing you to add technology-specific configurations as needed. Start simple and expand incrementally.

## Development Commands

Customize the following command examples based on your project requirements:

### General Projects
```bash
# Add project-specific commands here
# Examples:
# npm install          # Install dependencies
# npm run dev          # Start development server
# npm run build        # Production build
# npm test             # Run tests
```

### Technology Stack Specific Settings
Add appropriate commands based on the technologies used in your project:

- **Node.js**: package.json scripts section
- **Python**: requirements.txt and virtual environment
- **Go**: go.mod and Go commands
- **Rust**: Cargo.toml and cargo commands
- **Others**: Tools and commands suitable for your project

## Template Usage Guide

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Use the Template**: Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub
2. **Customize the Project**: Update the project overview in CLAUDE.md
3. **Start Development**: Add necessary configuration files and begin your project

### Benefits of Simple Configuration

This template starts with a simple configuration, which allows you to:
- Add only necessary features incrementally
- Keep project complexity to a minimum
- Optimize integration with Claude Code

## Customization Guidelines

1. **Technology-Specific Setup**
   - Add necessary configuration files for your project (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.)
   - Configure additional exclusion items in .gitignore
   - Create dependency management files

2. **Claude Code Optimization**
   - Configure the development commands section to match your project
   - Add important project-specific notes to this file
   - Effectively utilize project memory

3. **Extensions as Needed**
   - Add GitHub workflow files
   - Add security configurations
   - Add community files (CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)

## Important Notes

### File Structure

- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code project memory
- `docs/` - Project documentation (research, planning, and implementation records)
- `ai-rules/` - AI-related rules and guidelines

### Maintenance

- Regularly update dependencies
- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Review settings in accordance with Claude Code updates
