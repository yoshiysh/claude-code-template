## Ultrathink

Executes a systematic and structured thinking process for complex challenges and important decisions.

### Usage

```bash
# Request deep thinking from Claude
"Consider [challenge] using ultrathink"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Architecture design consideration
"Consider whether to choose microservices or monolith using ultrathink"

# Technology selection analysis
"Analyze whether Rust or TypeScript is more suitable for this project using ultrathink"

# Deep problem-solving
"Examine causes and improvement methods for poor application performance using ultrathink"
```

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Business decisions
"Consider new feature prioritization using ultrathink. From user value, development cost, and technical risk perspectives"

# System design
"Consider authentication system design using ultrathink. Taking security, scalability, and maintainability into account"

# Trade-off analysis
"Analyze GraphQL vs REST API choice using ultrathink. Based on project requirements"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/legacy_code.js
"Plan refactoring strategy for this legacy code using ultrathink"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break down challenges into component elements
2. **MECE Analysis** - Organize comprehensively without gaps or overlaps
3. **Multi-perspective Examination** - Analyze from technical, business, and user perspectives
4. **Interactive Confirmation** - Confirm with user at critical decision points
5. **Evidence-based Proposals** - Conclusions based on data and logic

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex technical debt resolution
"Consider strategy for modernizing a 10-year legacy system using ultrathink. Include phased migration, risks, and ROI"

# Organizational challenges
"Consider development team scaling strategy using ultrathink. Assuming expansion from current 5 to 20 people"

# Database migration
"Analyze PostgreSQL to DynamoDB migration using ultrathink. Consider cost, performance, and operational aspects"
```

### Important Notes

Ultrathink is optimal for challenges that require time and deep consideration. For simple questions or immediate answers, use regular question format.
