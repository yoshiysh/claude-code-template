## Sequential Thinking

Solves complex problems step-by-step through dynamic and iterative thinking processes. A flexible approach that allows course corrections and reviews during the thinking process.

### Usage

```bash
# Request sequential thinking from Claude
"Consider [challenge] using sequential-thinking"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Algorithm design
"Design efficient caching strategy using sequential-thinking"

# Problem solving
"Solve database performance issues using sequential-thinking"

# Design consideration
"Consider real-time notification system design using sequential-thinking"
```

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Complex implementation strategy
"Consider authentication system implementation strategy using sequential-thinking. Taking OAuth2, JWT, and session management into account"

# Bug cause analysis
"Analyze memory leak causes using sequential-thinking. Include code review and profiling results"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/complex_module.js
"Plan refactoring strategy for this module using sequential-thinking"

# Technology selection
"Analyze frontend framework selection using sequential-thinking. Consider project requirements and constraints"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Initial Analysis** - Basic understanding and decomposition of the problem
2. **Hypothesis Generation** - Develop hypotheses for solutions
3. **Validation and Correction** - Validate hypotheses and modify as needed
4. **Branching and Exploration** - Explore multiple solution paths
5. **Integration and Conclusion** - Derive optimal solutions

### Features

- **Dynamic Adjustment** - Ability to change direction mid-thought
- **Hypothesis Testing** - Cycle of hypothesis formation and validation
- **Branching Thinking** - Simultaneous exploration of multiple thought paths
- **Gradual Refinement** - Step-by-step solution refinement
- **Flexibility** - Policy changes based on new information

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex system design
"Consider e-commerce microservice design using sequential-thinking. Include order processing, inventory management, and payment integration"

# Security design
"Consider API security design using sequential-thinking. Include authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logs"

# Performance optimization
"Consider large-scale data processing optimization using sequential-thinking. Consider memory usage, processing speed, and scalability"

# Dependency management
"Consider monorepo dependency management strategy using sequential-thinking. Include build time, deployment, and test execution"
```

### Important Notes

Sequential-thinking is optimal for complex problems that require gradual deepening of thought. For simple questions or cases with clear answers, use regular question format.

### Usage Example

```bash
# Usage example
"Consider GraphQL schema design using sequential-thinking"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Initial Analysis: Analyze basic GraphQL schema requirements
# 2. Hypothesis Generation: Consider multiple design patterns
# 3. Validation: Validate pros and cons of each pattern
# 4. Branching: Explore new approaches as needed
# 5. Integration: Propose optimal schema design
```
