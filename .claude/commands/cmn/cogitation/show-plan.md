## Show Plan

Displays plans currently being executed or executed in the current session.

### Usage

```bash
/show-plan
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Check current plan
/show-plan
"Display currently executing plan"

# When no plan exists
/show-plan
"No plan exists in current session"
```

### Features

- Detects plans created with exit_plan_mode
- Searches for headings containing keywords like implementation plan, implementation content, plan
- Formats and displays plan content
- Clearly notifies when no plan exists

### Integration with Claude

```bash
# Check plan during implementation
"What was I implementing again?"
/show-plan

# Multiple tasks in progress
"Let me confirm the current plan again"
/show-plan

# Review after plan execution
"Show me the content of the plan I just executed"
/show-plan
```

### Detection Patterns

Based on plan formats generated by exit_plan_mode, detects the following patterns:

- Headings starting with `##` (containing plan, Plan keywords)
- `### Change Content`
- `### Implementation Content`
- `### Implementation Plan`
- Numbered headings like `### 1.`

### Important Notes

- Only displays plans within current session (does not include past sessions)
- Prioritizes displaying the latest plan
